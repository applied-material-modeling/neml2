/**
 * @brief The base class for interpolated variable
 *
 * This model requires two parameters, namely the "abscissa" and the "ordinate". The ordinate is
 * interpolated using an input (specified by the "argument" option) along the axis of abscissa.
 *
 * The interpolant's batch shape is defined as the broadcasted batch shapes of the abscissa and the
 * ordinate, after excluding the dimensions on which the interpolation happens.
 *
 * The general expectations for the batch shapes are:
 * 1. The abscissa and the ordinate should be batch-broadcastable.
 * 2. The abscissa should always be a Scalar. The ordinate can be of any primitive tensor type.
 * 3. The input (specified by option "argument") must be a Scalar.
 * 4. The input and the interpolant should be batch-broadcastable.
 * 5. Broadcasting the input with the interpolant should not alter its batch shape.
