   *
   * \p start and \p end must be broadcastable. The new batch dimension will be added at the
   * user-specified dimension \p dim which defaults to 0.
   *
   * For example, if \p start has shape `(3, 2; 5, 5)` and \p end has shape `(3, 1; 5, 5)`, then
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cpp
   * linspace(start, end, 100, 1);
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * will have shape `(3, 100, 2; 5, 5)`, note the location of the new dimension and the
   * broadcasting.
   *
   * @param start The starting tensor
   * @param end The ending tensor
   * @param nstep The number of steps with even spacing along the new dimension
   * @param dim Where to insert the new dimension
   * @return Tensor Linearly spaced tensor
