/**
 * @brief Use automatic differentiation (AD) to calculate the derivatives of a Tensor w.r.t. another
 * Tensor
 *
 * @warning
 * Torch (and hence NEML2) AD wasn't designed to compute the full Jacobian from the very beginning.
 * Using this method to calculate the full Jacobian is inefficient and is subjected to some
 * restrictions on batch shapes.
 *
 * @param y The `Tensor` to to be differentiated
 * @param xs The arguments to take derivatives with respect to
 * @param retain_graph Whether to retain the computation graph (necessary if y has base storage
 * size>1)
 * @param create_graph Whether to create the computation graph (necessary if you want to
 * differentiate the returned Jacobian)
 * @param allow_unused Whether to allow unused input argument \p x
 * @return Tensor \f$\partial y/\partial p\f$
