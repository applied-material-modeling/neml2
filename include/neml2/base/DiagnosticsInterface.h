  /**
   * @brief Check for common problems
   *
   * This method serves as the entry point for diagnosing common problems in object setup. The idea
   * behind this method is that while some errors could be detected at construction time, i.e., when
   * the object's constructor is called, it doesn't hinder other objects' creation. We therefore
   * would like to defer the detection of errors until after all objects have been created, collect
   * all errors at once, and present the user with a complete understanding of all errors
   * encountered.
   *
   * Note, however, if an error could interfere with other objects' creation, it should be raised
   * right away inside the constructor, instead of inside this method.
   *
   * @param diagnoses A vector of exceptions of type Diagnosis for each of the detected problem.
