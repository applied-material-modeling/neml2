/**
 * @brief The name of a tensor object that can be referenced in the input files.
 *
 * All tokens in the input files are essentially strings, and it is not always possible to represent
 * all quantities as strings. This class enables cross-referencing tensor or model output variable
 * (by name) defined in the input file. The object _name_ is used as the label, and the object value
 * is not resolved at parse time. The method TensorName::resolve() is used to explicitly resolve the
 * name to a tensor object or a model's output variable. Note that the resolution takes place upon
 * the first call to TensorName::resolve(), and subsequent calls simply return the cached value.
