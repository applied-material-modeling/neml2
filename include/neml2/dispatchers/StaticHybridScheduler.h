   * The setup method retrieves from input options a device list, along with the batch sizes,
   * capacities, and priorities for each device.
   *
   * The device list should be unique and non-empty. kCPU can appear at most once. When
   * multiple cuda devices are present, each of them must correspond to a specific device ID.
   *
   * One or more batch size should be provided. If the number of batch sizes is one, the same batch
   * size is associated with all devices. Otherwise, the number of batch sizes should match the
   * number of devices.
   *
   * Similarly, zero or more capacities should be provided. If the capacity list is empty, the
   * default capacities are the same as those used for batch sizes; if the number of capacities is
   * one, the same capacity is associated with all devices; otherwise, the number of capacities
   * should match the number of devices.
   *
   * An optional list of priorities can be provided. The number of priorities should match the
   * number of devices. If no priorities are provided, all devices have the same priority. Note that
   * this dispatcher chooses the device to dispatch not only based on the priority but also based on
   * the availability of the device. See next() for more details.
   *
   * \note For developers, below is a summary of the construct of Device:
   * Device represents a compute device on which a tensor is located. A device is uniquely
   * identified by a type, which specifies the type of machine it is (e.g. CPU or CUDA GPU), and a
   * device index or ordinal, which identifies the specific compute device when there is more than
   * one of a certain type. The device index is optional, and in its defaulted state represents
   * (abstractly) "the current device". Further, there are two constraints on the value of the
   * device index, if one is explicitly stored:
   * 1. A negative index represents the current device, a non-negative index
   *    represents a specific, concrete device,
   * 2. When the device type is CPU, the device index must be zero.
