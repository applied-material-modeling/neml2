# neml2
# nlprecond testbed case: vp_isoharden
# Derived from tests/regression/solid_mechanics/viscoplasticity/isoharden/model.i
#
# Differences from the parent regression scenario:
#   * [Drivers/regression] removed (no gold reference; this is a solver study)
#   * knobs exposed as HIT ${...} substitutions, supplied by studies.nlprecond.harness:
#       nbatch    -- dynamic batch members
#       npoint    -- time points; the driver takes npoint-1 steps
#       tfrac     -- fraction of the parent's full load history to cover. The
#                    harness sets it so the PER-STEP INCREMENT stays fixed as
#                    npoint shrinks -- fewer steps, not bigger ones. Increment
#                    size is a separate knob (dt_scale), which scales tfrac.
#       flow_n    -- PerzynaPlasticFlowRate exponent (rate sensitivity)
#       ls_iters  -- max_linesearch_iterations; 1 == full Newton step (no line search)
#       max_its   -- Newton iteration cap
#   * [Solvers/newton] is always NewtonWithLineSearch so ls_iters spans both arms
#   * the predictor wiring is left intact; the harness strips it for the
#     "nopred" arms by deleting the `predictor = '...'` line(s)
