@insert-title:tutorials-models

NEML2 comes with a large collection of material models. These material models can be either used on their own or serve as building blocks for more complicated material models.

Once NEML2 is [installed](@ref install), there is no need to write additional C++ code to define the material model of interest -- NEML2 can read from text-based [input files](@ref tutorials-models-input-file) to dynamically construct material models.

This set of tutorials walk through typical use cases for interacting with existing NEML2 material models.
