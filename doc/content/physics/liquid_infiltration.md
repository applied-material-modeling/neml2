# Liquid Infiltration {#liquid-infiltration}

[TOC]

The liquid infiltration physics module is a collection objects serving as building blocks for composing material chemical and physical interaction between the solid (\f$S\f$), infiltrated by liquid (\f$L\f$) to create a product (\f$P\f$) at the solid-liquid interface. The framework and usage of the model is explained below, with both mathematical formulations and example input files.

## Framework

### Representative Volume Element
The infiltration process for a material considers a cylindrical Representative Volume Element (RVE) with radius R and height H depicts a Solid capillary of radius \f$r_0\f$, corresponding to the initial porosity of \f$\sqrt{\varphi_0}\f$. The mathematical description of the model uses cylindrical coordinates and assumes axisymmetry around \f$ r = 0\f$. Figure below depicts the schematic for the RVE.

The span of Liquid and the span of the Product layer are denoted by \f$h_L\f$ and \f$h_P\f$, respectively. In addition, define \f$\alpha_i\f$ as the amount of substance in the RVE and \f$\Omega_i\f$ as the molar volume (SI units: mol per volume), with subscripts taking \f$L\f$, \f$S\f$, and \f$P\f$ representing the infiltrated Liquid, the porous material Solid, and the Product produces by the chemical interaction between the Liquid and the Solid, respectively. 

![Fig. 1: RVE -- need to updated](asset/lsi_rve.png){html: width=100%} 

Key assumptions made throughout the derivation are:
-  Liquid remains liquid over the entire course of reaction, i.e., no phase change.
-  The reaction is irreversible.
-  Formation of the initial Product layer is immediate once Liquid comes into contact with Solid.
-  Once Product is formed, reaction rate is primarily limited by the diffusion of Liquid through Product to the Product-Solid interface.
-  The Product wall thickness remains uniform during the infiltration.
-  The Liquid front inside a capillary wall is flat.
-  In the abundance of Liquid, the height of Product layer follows the Liquid front. This assumptions might break down when the layer of Product is relatively thick.

> The model consists of many sub-models that are general such that developers can swap out different chemical interactions for suitable liquid-solid systems.

The following nondimensionalization is applied to the constitutive model (Fig. 1) for the reactive infiltration process.
\f[
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            &\ \bar{\delta}_P = \frac{\delta_P}{R}, \quad \bar{r}_0 = \dfrac{r_0}{R} = \sqrt{\varphi_0}, \quad \bar{r}_1 = \dfrac{r_1}{R} = \sqrt{\varphi_0} -M\bar{\delta}_P \\
            &\ \bar{h}_P = \frac{h_P}{H}, \quad \bar{h}_L = \frac{h_L}{H}=\frac{\alpha_L\Omega_L}{\bar{r}_1^2}.
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
\f]
The complete state of the RVE is therefore denoted by the tuple \f$\left( \alpha_L, \bar{\delta}_P^*, \bar{h}_P \right)\f$, where \f$\bar{\delta}_P^* = \sqrt{\bar{\delta}_P}\f$.

> The use of \f$\bar{\delta}_P^*\f$ is to ensure physical solution for \f$\bar{\delta}_P\f$

The effective porosity can be written in terms of the nondimensional variables as 
\f[
    \varphi = \bar{r}_0^2 \left( 1 - \bar{h}_P \right) + \bar{r}_1^2 \left( \bar{h}_P - \bar{h}_L \right).
\f]
where
\f[
    \bar{h}_L = \dfrac{\Omega_L \alpha_L}{\bar{r}_1^2}
\f]


Finally, the composition of the solid is:
\f[
    \alpha_S = \frac{1}{\Omega_{S}}(1-\varphi - \alpha_P\Omega_P - \alpha_L\Omega_L)
\f]

### Constraint
The following constraints apply to the reaction constitutive model:
- The inlet of the RVE is positive,
    \f[
        r_1 \ge 0
    \f]
    When \f$r_1=0\f$ , no liquid can enter the RVE, i.e. \f$\dot{\alpha}_L^I=0\f$. Therefore, the simulation is halted.
- The reaction stops when there is no carbon remaining in the RVE,
    \f[
        \bar{\delta}_P \le \min\left(\dfrac{1-\sqrt{\varphi_0}}{1-M },\dfrac{\sqrt{\varphi_0}}{M}\right)=\bar{\delta}_P^c.
    \f]
    Here, within our assumption that the silicon carbide wall thickness remains uniform during the infiltration, Product layer only grows in the \f$+z\f$ direction. The reaction equation becomes
    \f[
        \dot{\bar{\delta}}_P = 0
    \f]
- The silicon carbide layer cannot span beyond the RVE,
    \f[
        \bar{h}_P \le 1.
    \f]
    Since \f$\bar{h}_P\f$ is irreversible, \f$\bar{h}_P = 1\f$ corresponds to \f$\bar{\dot{h}}_P = 0\f$, implies
    \f[
        \dot{\alpha}_L^O = \dot{\alpha}_L^I 
    \f]
    where the injection rate of Liquid \f$\dot{\alpha}_L^I\f$ is prescribed. \f$\dot{\alpha}_L^O\f$ represents the outflow of Liquid

> \f$\dot{\alpha}_L^O = 0\f$ for \f$h_L<1\f$.

### Governing Equations
When including the constraint, the initial-value problem (IVP) corresponding to the constitutive model is

- The growth of Product thickness in the \f$\pm r\f$ direction (`ProductThicknessGrowthRate` model),
\f[
   \dot{\bar{\delta}}_P = R(\bar{h}_L,\bar{h}_P) G \left[1-H\left(\dfrac{\bar{\delta}_P}{\bar{\delta}_P^c}-1 \right)\right]
\f]
    Here \f$G\f$ denotes the thickeness growth of the Product when Liquid in abundant. When the Liquid is deficient, the Product's thickness growth is reduced by a factor of \f$R\f$.
    \f$H(x)\f$ is a Heaviside function.

    For the current implementation,
    \f[
        R(\bar{h}_L,\bar{h}_P) = \left\{\dfrac{\bar{h}_L}{\bar{h}_P}\right\}^p
    \f]
    with \f$\{.\}\f$ denotes the Macaulay brackets to ensure \f$\left(\dfrac{\bar{h}_L}{\bar{h}_P}\right)^p\f$ has real values. This is done with `LiquidDeficientPowerScale` model.

    and 
    \f[
        G = \bar{D} \frac{\rho_L}{\rho_P} \frac{\bar{r}_1} {\bar{\delta}_P\left[\sqrt{\varphi_0}+(1-2M)\bar{\delta}_P\right]}
    \f]
    with \f$\rho_L, \rho_P\f$ denotes the density of Liquid and Product respectively. \f$G\f$ is derived based on 1D diffusion of Liquid through the Product to react with the Solid at the Solid-Product interface, accounting for the polar coordinate system of the RVE. This is done with `LiquidProductDiffusion1D` model.

- The growth of Product height in the \f$ z \f$ direction (`ProductGrowthWithLiquid` model)
\f[
    \phi = \bar{r}_1^2 \bar{h}_P - \alpha_L\Omega_L \geq 0, \quad \dot{\bar{h}}_P \geq 0, \quad \phi \dot{\bar{h}}_P = 0,
\f]
    This is equivalent to the Fischer-Burmeister complementary condition (`FischerBurmeister` model),
\f[
  \phi + \dot{\bar{h}}_P - \sqrt{ \phi^2 + \dot{\bar{h}}_P^2 } = 0
\f]
- The local Liquid mass balance (`ChemMassBalance` model)
\f[
     \dot{\alpha}_L = \dot{\alpha}_L^I + \dot{\alpha}_L^R +\dot{\alpha}_L^O
\f]
    where 
\f[
    \dot{\alpha}_L^R = \dot{\alpha}_S = -\dot{\alpha}_P
\f]
This is done with Composing two models: `ProductGeometricRelation` and `VariableRate`.

An implicit time integration scheme is required to solve this stiff IVP with a reasonable time step size. This is done with `ImplicitUpdate` model.

## Supporting model

These sub-models are built in order to solve the IVP - 3 equations with 3 unknowns \f$\left( \alpha_L, \bar{\delta}_P^*, \bar{h}_P \right)\f$, where \f$\bar{\delta}_P^* = \sqrt{\bar{\delta}_P}\f$. For details input and output of each model, refer to the Syuntax Documentaion.

> CAUTION: The state variable for all of these models is \f$\bar{\delta}_P^*\f$!

### Size of the Inlet
Model object: `InletGap`

This model calculates the inlet size of the RVE, following
\f[
    \bar{r}_1 = \sqrt{\varphi_0} -M{\bar{\delta}_P^*}^2
\f]

Example input file that defines the size of the inlet.

\f[
    g = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\tanh{\left[n\left(\dfrac{x}{x_c}-x_0\right)\right]}
\f]

> For use in the liquid infiltration, make sure to use the \f$1-g\f$ by settting `one_subtract_condition = True`.

### Product height growth with Liquid front
Model object: `ProductGrowthWithLiquid`

When there is sufficient Liquid, the span (height) of the Product and and Liquid is equal. In addition, the flat liquid front is assumed. Based on geometric relation, these imply the relationship through output variable \f$\phi\f$ as,
\f[
    \phi = \bar{r}_1^2 \bar{h}_P - \alpha_L\Omega_L
\f]

Example input file that defines the Product height growth with Liquid front.
```

        type = ProductGrowthWithLiquid
        liquid_molar_volume = 0.7
        product_height = 'state/h'

### Fischer-Burmeister condition
Model object: `FischerBurmeister`

If \f$ a \ge 0, b \ge 0, ab = 0 \f$ then Fischer-Burmeister complementary condition is
 \f[ 
    a+b-\sqrt{a^2+b^2} = 0 
\f]

> For use in liquid infiltration, condition_a is `ProductGrowthWithLiquid` and condition_b is `VariableRate` of a state variable corresponding to Product's height. The output of the model is one of the residual for the IVP.

Example input file that defines the Fischer-Burmeister condition.

    []
[]
```

### Maximum Product thickness
Model object: `ProductThicknessLimit`

The product's maximum thickness governs by the growth condition \f$M\f$ and the amount of Solid to react with, aka initial porosity, \f$\varphi\f$ (see Fig. 1). Based on geometric relation,
\f[
    \bar{\delta}_P^c = \min\left(\dfrac{1-\sqrt{\varphi_0}}{1-M },\dfrac{\sqrt{\varphi_0}}{M}\right).
\f]

Example input file that defines the maximum Product thickness.
```
[Models]
    [model]
        type = ProductThicknessLimit
        initial_porosity = 0.5
        product_thickness_growth_ratio = 'M'
        product_thickness = 'state/delta'
        limit_ratio = 'state/dratio'
    []
[]
```

### Ideal Product thickness growth
Model object: `LiquidProductDiffusion1D`

Assuming quasi steady state of Liquid infiltration, consider the same RVE as in Fig. 1 with a constant \f$h_P\f$, the mass \f$m_P\f$ of the product is,
\f[
    \begin{align}
        m_P = \rho_PV_P = \rho_P\pi ((r_1+\delta_P)^2-r_1^2)h_P \\
        \dot{m}_P = 2\rho_P\pi h_P(r_0+(1-2M)\delta_P)\dot{\delta}_P
    \end{align}
\f]

Product grows due to the diffusion between the Liquid-Product interface and Product-Solid interface, with a diffusion coefficient \f$D\f$.  Then,
\f[
    \dot{m}_P=D\nabla C \cdot \boldsymbol{n}
\f]

where \f$C\f$ is the mass concentration, \f$\boldsymbol{n}\f$ is the normal vector. Assuming Liquid reacts immediately with Solid at the Product-Solid interface, i.e. the concentration of Liquid (with molar mass \f$M_L\f$) at the Product-Solid interface is zero, then
\f[
    \dot{m}_P = 2D \pi r_1 h_P \frac{\rho_L}{\delta_P} 
\f]
Combining, the Product thickness height growth, in abundance of Liquid, is
\f[
        \dot{\delta}_P = D \frac{\rho_L}{\rho_P} \frac{r_1}{\delta_P(r_0+(1-2M)\delta_P)}
\f]
Equivalently in normalized units,
\f[
    {\dot{\bar{\delta}}_P^*} = \dfrac{D}{l_c^2} \frac{\rho_L}{\rho_P} \frac{\bar{r}_1} {2{\bar{\delta}_P^*}^3\left[\sqrt{\varphi_0}+(1-2M){\bar{\delta}^*_P}^2\right]}
\f]

        type = LiquidProductDiffusion1D
        liquid_product_density_ratio = 0.8
        initial_porosity = 0.5
        product_thickness_growth_ratio = 0.57
        liquid_product_diffusion_coefficient = 1e-4

[]
```

### Reduction Scaling for Product thickness growth when Liquid is deficient
Model object: `LiquidDeficientPowerScale`

When the Liquid in the RVE is insufficient to sustain the Product's thickness growth, the Product's thickness growth rate decreases from the ideal condition by a factor \f$R\f$ as
\f[
    R = \left\{\dfrac{\bar{h}_L}{\bar{h}_P}\right\}^p = \left\{\dfrac{\alpha_L \Omega_L}{\bar{r}_1^2 \bar{h}_P}\right\}^p
\f]
with \f$\{.\}\f$ denotes the Macaulay brackets to ensure \f$\left(\dfrac{\bar{h}_L}{\bar{h}_P}\right)^p\f$ has real values. Note that when Liquid is sufficient, aka \f$\bar{h}_L = \bar{h}_P\f$, then \f$R = 1\f$.

Example input file that defines the power scale reduction scaling for Product thickness growth when Liquid is deficient.
```
[Models]
    [model]
        type = LiquidDeficientPowerScale
        liquid_molar_volume = 1e-5
        power = 2.3
        product_height = 'state/h'

### Effective Product thickness growth
Model object: `ProductThicknessGrowthRate`

The total effective combination of the product thickness growth rate, combining the `ideal_thickness_growth` (\f$R\f$) with `scale`(\f$S\f$) to account for liquid deficiency and `switch`(\f$H\f$) to limit the growth rate by a critical value.
\f[
    {\dot{\bar{\delta}}_P^*} - R S H = 0
\f]

> The output of the model is one of the residual for the IVP. To use for liquid infiltration, make sure to have `switch` as an appropriate `ComposedModel` between `ProductThicknessLimit` and `SwitchingFunction`. Refer to the Complete Input File under Framework section for example. 

Example input file that defines effective Product thickness growth.

        type = ProductThicknessGrowthRate
        thickness_rate = 'state/ddot'
        scale = 'state/scale'
        ideal_thickness_growth = 'state/dideal'

### Product geometric relation with Liquid
Model object: `ProductGeometricRelation`

Product's geometry dictates the amount of the Product in the RVE,
\f[
    \alpha_P = \dfrac{\bar{h}_P}{\Omega_P} \left( 2\bar{r}_1 {\bar{\delta}_P^*}^2 + {\bar{\delta}_P^*}^4 \right)
\f]

Example input file that defines the Product geometric relation with Liquid.
```
[Models]
    [model]
        type = ProductGeometricRelation
        product_molar_volume = 1e-5
        product_height = 'state/h'
        inlet_gap = 'state/r1'
        product_thickness = 'state/delta'
        product_saturation = 'state/alphaP'
    []
[]
```

### Liquid total mass balance
Model object: `ChemMassBalance`

The total mass balance of the Liquid in the RVE, subjecting to inlet rate \f$\dot{\alpha}_L^I\f$, outlet rate \f$\dot{\alpha}_L^O\f$ and reaction rate \f$\dot{\alpha}_R^I\f$
\f[
    \dot{\alpha}_L - \dot{\alpha}_L^I - \dot{\alpha}_L^O + (-\dot{\alpha}_L^R) = 0
\f]
When \f$\bar{h}_P < 1\f$, \f$\dot{\alpha}_L^O = 0\f$. Therefore,
\f[
    \dot{\alpha}_L - S \dot{\alpha}_L^I + (-\dot{\alpha}_L^R) = 0
\f]
with `switch` (\f$S\f$) can be written from Heaviside function as
\f[
    S = 1 - H\left( \bar{h}_P -1 \right)
\f] 

> The output of the model is one of the residual for the IVP. To use for liquid infiltration, use `SwitchingFunction` model with appropriate input for `switch` (\f$S\f$). Refer to the Complete Input File under Framework section for example.

        current = 'state/current'
        total = 'residual/total'
