# Testing {#testing}

[TOC]

It is of paramount importance to ensure the correctness of the implementation. NEML2 comes with extensive testing for both its C++ backend and the Python package.

## C++ backend

### Setup {#testing-cpp}

By default when `NEML2_TESTS` is set to `ON`, three test suites are built under the specified build directory:

- `tests/unit/unit_tests`: Collection of tests to ensure individual objects are working correctly.
- `tests/regression/regression_tests`: Collection of tests to avoid regression.
- `tests/verification/verification_tests`: Collection of verification problems.

The tests assume the working directory to be the `tests` directory relative to the repository root. For Visual Studio Code users, the [C++ TestMate](https://github.com/matepek/vscode-catch2-test-adapter) extension can be used to automatically discover and run tests. In the extension settings, the "Working Directory" variable should be set to `${workspaceFolder}/tests`. The `settings.json` file shall contain the following entry:
```json
{
  "testMate.cpp.test.workingDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}/tests",
}
```

### Catch tests {#testing-catch-tests}

A Catch test refers to a test directly written in C++ source code within the Catch2 framework. It offers the highest level of flexibility, but requires more effort to set up. To understand how a Catch2 test works, please refer to the [official Catch2 documentation](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/v2.x/docs/tutorial.md).

### Unit tests {#testing-unit-tests}

A model unit test examines the outputs of a `Model` given a predefined set of inputs. Model unit tests can be directly designed using the input file syntax with the `ModelUnitTest` type. A variety of checks can be turned on and off based on input file options. To list a few: `check_first_derivatives` compares the implemented first order derivatives of the model against finite-differencing results, and the test is marked as passing only if the two derivatives are within tolerances specified with `derivative_abs_tol` and `derivative_rel_tol`; if `check_cuda` is set to `true`, all checks are repeated a second time on GPU (if available).

All input files for model unit tests should be stored inside `tests/unit/models`. Every input file with the `.i` extension will be automatically discovered and executed. To run all the model unit tests, use the following commands
```
cd tests
../build/unit/unit_tests models
```

To run a specific model unit test, use the `-c` command line option followed by the relative location of the input file, i.e.
```
cd tests
../build/unit/unit_tests models -c solid_mechanics/LinearIsotropicElasticity.i
```

### Regression tests {#testing-regression-tests}

A model regression test runs a `Model` using a user specified driver. The results are compared against a predefined reference (stored on the disk checked into the repository). The test passes only if the current results are the same as the predefined reference (again within specified tolerances). The regression tests ensure the consistency of implementations across commits. Currently, `TransientRegression` is the only supported type of regression test.

Each input file for model regression tests should be stored inside a separate folder inside `tests/regression`. Every input file with the `.i` extension will be automatically discovered and executed. To run all the model regression tests, use the `regression_tests` executable followed by the physics module, i.e.
```
cd tests
../build/regression/regression_tests "solid mechanics"
```
To run a specific model regression test, use the `-c` command line option followed by the relative location of the input file, i.e.
```
cd tests
../build/regression/regression_tests "solid mechanics" -c viscoplasticity/chaboche/model.i
```
Note that the regression test expects an option `reference` which specifies the relative location to the reference solution.

### Verification tests {#testing-verification-tests}

The model verification test is similar to the model regression test in terms of workflow. The difference is the a verification test defines the reference solution using NEML, the predecessor of NEML2. Since NEML was developed with strict software assurance, the verification tests ensure that the migration from NEML to NEML2 does not cause any regression in software quality.

Each input file for model verification tests should be stored inside a separate folder inside `tests/verification`. Every input file with the `.i` extension will be automatically discovered and executed. To run all the model verification tests, use the `verification_tests` executable followed by the physics module, i.e.
```
cd tests
../build/verification/verification_tests "solid mechanics"
```

To run a specific model verification test, use the `-c` command line option followed by the relative location of the input file, i.e.
```
cd tests
../build/verification/verification_tests "solid mechanics" -c chaboche/chaboche.i
```
The regression test compares variables (specified using the `variables` option) against reference values (specified using the `references` option). The reference variables can be read using input objects with type `VTestTimeSeries`.

## Python package

### Setup {#testing-python}

A collection of tests are available under `python/tests` to ensure the NEML2 Python package is working correctly. For Visual Studio Code users, the [Python](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python) extension can be used to automatically discover and run tests. In the extension settings, the "Pytest Enabled" variable shall be set to true. In addition, "pytestArgs" shall provide the location of tests, i.e. "${workspaceFolder}/python/tests". The `settings.json` file shall contain the following entries:
```json
{
  "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
  "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
    "${workspaceFolder}/python/tests"
  ],
}
```

If the Python bindings are built (with `NEML2_PYBIND` set to `ON`) but are not installed to the site-packages directory (i.e. during development), pytest will not be able to import the %neml2 package unless the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` is modified according to the specified build directory. For Visual Studio Code users, create a `.env` file in the repository's root and include an entry `PYTHONPATH=build/dev/python` (assuming the build directory is `build/dev` which is the default from CMake presets), and the Python extension will be able to import the NEML2 Python package.

### pytest {#testing-pytest}

The Python tests use the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html) framework. To run tests using commandline, invoke `pytest` with the correct `PYTHONPATH`, i.e.

```
PYTHONPATH=build/dev/python pytest python/tests
```

To run a specific test case, use

```
PYTHONPATH=build/dev/python pytest "python/tests/test_Model.py::test_forward"
```
which runs the function named `test_forward` defined in the `python/tests/test_Model.py` file.
