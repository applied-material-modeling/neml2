## Configure and build (revisted)

The CMake configure and build commands were introduced in the [Installation Guide](@ref install-user). The commands were

```
cmake --preset release -S .
cmake --build --preset release
```
which uses the CMake preset named "release". The configure and build commands can take other CMake presets in the following form

```
cmake --preset {configurePreset} -S .
cmake --build --preset {buildPreset}
```
where `{configurePreset}` and `buildPreset` should be substituted with a configure preset and a build preset, respectively.
In addition to the "release" preset, NEML2 offers a few configure and build presets useful for typical development workflows, defined in `CMakePresets.json`. Typical workflows and their corresponding presets are listed below.

### Developing the C++ backend

```
cmake --preset dev -S .
cmake --build --preset dev-cpp
```
See also [Testing/C++ backend/Setup](@ref testing-cpp) for how to run tests once the library is built.

Unlike the "release" preset, the "dev" preset builds NEML2 with debug info (i.e., `-g`). Debuggers (gdb, lldb, etc.) can be used to step through the execution, set break points, navigate through backtrace, etc.

### Developing the Python package

```
cmake --preset dev -S .
cmake --build --preset dev-python
```
See also [Testing/Python package/Setup](@ref testing-python) for how to run tests once the package is built.

### Writing documentation

```
cmake --preset dev -S .
cmake --build --preset dev-doc
```
Once the documentation is built, the site can be previewed locally using
```
firefox build/dev/doc/build/html/index.html
```
Feel free to replace `firefox` with other browsers that support rendering of static html pages, e.g., `google-chrome`.

### Benchmarking

```
cmake --preset benchmark -S .
cmake --build benchmark
```
The "benchmark" preset builds the core C++ library along with the tests. In addition, it builds a simple [runner](@ref runner) to parse and run arbitrary input files. All test executables and the runner are linked against gperftools' CPU profiler for profiling purposes.

### Coverage

```
cmake --preset coverage -S .
cmake --build coverage
```
The unit testing executable is built with coverage flags set. Standard code coverage tools such as `gcov` and `lcov` can be used to capture and record coverage data.

## Code formatting and linting

The C++ source code is formatted using `clang-format`. A `.clang-format` file is provided at the repository root specifying the formatting requirements. When using an IDE providing plugins or extensions to formatting C++ source code, it is important to
1. Point the plugin/extension to use the `.clang-format` file located at NEML2's repository root.
2. Associate file extensions `.h` and `.cxx` with C++.

The Python scripts shall be formatted using `black`. Formatting requirements are specified under the `[black]` section in `pyproject.toml`.

All pull requests will be run through `clang-format` and `black` to ensure formatting consistency.

For linting, a `.clang-tidy` file is provided at the repository root to specify expected checks.
